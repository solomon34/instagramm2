-Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "actionpack":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    actionpack (= 6.0.2.1)

  In Gemfile:
    rails (~> 6.0.2, >= 6.0.2.1) was resolved to 6.0.2.1, which depends on
      actionpack (= 6.0.2.1)

    simple_form (~> 3.5) was resolved to 3.5.1, which depends on
      actionpack (> 4, < 5.2)

    rails (~> 6.0.2, >= 6.0.2.1) was resolved to 6.0.2.1, which depends on
      sprockets-rails (>= 2.0.0) was resolved to 3.2.1, which depends on
        actionpack (>= 4.0)

  Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
  the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.


- We're sorry but something went wrong error;
  Gemfile had;
  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.2.0.2' which was the wrong version of the gem

  I (Baba) changed to
  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.4', '>= 3.4.1'
  which corrected the Bug.  Solomon I wouldn't expect you to find this error at the coding stage where you are now.

  
  _form.html.haml file error
  syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting end 

  Your code had this;

        - @pic.erros.full_message.each do |msg| 
        %li= msg

  Indentation error, this is what it should be
  
          - @pic.erros.full_message.each do |msg| 
            %li= msg
